# This version uses automatically created volumes
# If the volumes don't exist when 'docker-compose up' is executed
# the volumes are created. The name of volume is <project_name>_<volume_name>
# By default <project_name> is the name of the directory in which docker-compose
# is executed. For example, if you run 'docker-compose up' in directory 'test'
# then 'jenkins_home' volume gets created with name 'test_jenkins_home'
# We override the default behavior by setting volume name explicitly so the
# volume name does not depend on the directory where compose file resides

# The volumes are not removed when 'docker-compose down' is executed.

# You can detach from the containers by starting them with 'docker-compose up --detach'
